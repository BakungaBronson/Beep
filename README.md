### Beep V1.0

## Operating System
This program runs on Windows 10 so far. The next version will support Linux and Mac Os.

## Description
After having a number of laptops over the years. I have come to realise that the number one cause of battery damage for the average laptop user is overcharging. This can happen when we become too busy to keep track of the battery percentage down in the taskbar and as a result, we leave the battery plugged in for anything from 10 more minutes all the way up to 3 hours before noticing that the battery is full.

Beep is a python3 program that uses toast notifications to inform the user when their battery is full in an attempt to stop laptop battery damage due to overcharging. 

## Requirements
This python program uses two libraries namely: psutil and win10toast_click. Both can be installed using pip with the "pip install psutil" and "pip install win10toast_click" commands respectively. If you however use the windows executable there is no need to install the above dependencies because they are bundled into the executable.
